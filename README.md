# Matt's Component Library

Component library for random components I build & maintain for different websites.

This uses Foundation's style library for some css

Depending on component use, it may be necessary to import the global style.scss from dist/build/style.scss. You can override the settings.scss in there by updating the variables in your own scss files after importing the global style.scss.
